# EduCube
*This Project was done as part of our Design Thinking and Innovation module at Singapore University of Design and Technology.*

EduCUBE is a revolutionary tool designed to transform the classroom environment, enhancing student learning experiences and interactions. 
With a focus on optimizing student-student, student-speaker, and student-teaching assistant interactions, 
EduCUBE addresses common challenges students face in maintaining attention and engagement in class.

### Problem Statement
How Might We Enhance Studentâ€™s Learning Experience in Classroom?

1. Students are not able to keep up with/ understand the lesson materials.
2. Students may also be afraid to ask questions
3. Students are not being engaged enough by the professor.
4. Students are occupied with other things such as eating or doing other module
homeworks.
5. Students cannot see what is presented on the board/screen at the front.

In order to address these problem statements, we came up with Educube as a solution.
